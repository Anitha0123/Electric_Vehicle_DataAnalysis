Data Analysis on Electric Vehicle

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) data using various data visualization techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Choropleth maps, and Racing Bar Plots.

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, Univariate and Bivariate analysis is performed to uncover insights from the EV dataset. This involves visualizing the distribution of individual variables and examining relationships between different variables to understand patterns and trends.

### Task 2: Choropleth Map
A Choropleth map is created using `plotly.express` to display the number of EVs by location. The map provides a geographical overview of EV distribution, allowing us to see which areas have a higher or lower number of vehicles.

### Task 3: Racing Bar Plot
A Racing Bar Plot animation is created to showcase the count of different EV makes over the years. The dynamic visualization helps in observing trends in EV manufacturing and popularity over time.
